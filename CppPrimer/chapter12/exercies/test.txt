They can't do that if they are busy with routine tasks.

developed and used by the Percona technical staff, 
that are engineered to perform a variety of MySQL® and MongoDB® server and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually – freeing your DBAs for work that helps you achieve your business goals.

business evolves without interrupting their 24x7x365 operations.
